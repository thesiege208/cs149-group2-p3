I pulled the branch, thinking it would do an outer-join kinda thing. I didnt realize it would do an inner-join.
So I reverted the pull, and now a copy of the old master branch is in a new branch called "revert-1-patch-2"
Sorry about that.

List of what I changed in the code:
1. Moved SRAND back to main function for better random times
2. Fixed the midSeller function. 
  It went row 5 4 3 
  Now goes row 5 6 4 7 3 8 2 9 1 10
3. Added the broadcast so now all threads sell at the same time. 
  They still initialize on their own. Only the actual sell calls have to wait.
4. Added an extra printTable after each sold seat, as instructed by the requirements
